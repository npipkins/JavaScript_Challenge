# JavaScript_Challenge



## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

That's why we are hiring you. We need you to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset we provide](StarterCode/static/js/data.js). We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though... we only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.

You can handle this... right? The planet Earth needs to know what we have found!

## Automic Table and Date Search
While using d3 to create the table body, use the data provided to loop through the UFO sightings, append table rows and select desired columns. 

Update the HTML page to make the filter button work relative to the datetime entered. The code will listen for events and search throught the datetime columne to find the UFO sightings that match the desired input.

## Multiple Search Categories
Update the filter search box to allow more filtering selections.
